My Greatest strengths are that I am an empathetic person who was killed at relating to people and making them feel hurt in one memorable instance from earlier this year I was on a support call with the customer is contract we had terminated reinstating the service agreement we would have increased her rates dramatically she was understandably upset and felt trap because she needed car insurance for her and her family it became clear very quickly that we couldn't meet her needs but I wanted her to walk away with a favorable impression of the service we had provided I talked her through some of the other options even letting her know of other providers who might be able to offer a lower rate so she could avoid a lapse in coverage in the feedback survey forI have a very few weaknesses but one of my greatest weakness is that I sometimes focus too much on the details of a project and spend too much time analysing the final points I have been striving to improve in this area by checking in with myself at regular intervals and giving myself a chance to re focusing on the bigger picture that way I can still ensure quality without getting so much caught up in the details that it affect my productivity for the team's ability to meet the deadline but I am pretty sure that I am working on this weakness and I'll get on it soon and recently stone progress in getting this weakness
